## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Heavy review sweep (2026-07-07, "true recall" edition).** Recall: routing search now retrieves wide (30 candidates) and decides narrow — both channels capped at 5 BEFORE fusion, which dropped correct skills at candidate generation; the router also matches tasks directly against approved reflex names/descriptions. FTS rebuilt with **porter stemming** (schema v16, rowids preserved — no re-embed): "committing" now matches "commit". Recency no longer halves a cold memory's relevance (floored at 0.75); RRF weight raised 15→50 so fusion actually reorders; per-type `rank_multiplier` (defined since the registry existed, never read) is finally wired. Measured: seeded R@1 82%→85%, MRR 0.899→0.917, R@5 stays 100%; the field-observed routing miss now resolves to its reflex.
- **Token diet.** MCP tool list 6,669→5,138 tokens/session (legacy add_* tools removed from the list — handlers still accept them; conversation/prompt folded into unified `memory_add`; `auto_extract` merged into `suggest_capture`; boilerplate trimmed). Search responses drop the duplicated injection-policy preamble (~85 tok/call); `memory_route` uses a one-line wrapper (~90 tok/call); `read_item` returns compact JSON.
- **Persistent query-embedding cache** (`~/.engram/embed_cache.db`, L2 under the in-process LRU, `ENGRAM_EMBED_CACHE=off` to disable): repeated CLI searches 1.02s→0.10s — the CLI is a fresh process per call and previously always paid the ~100ms Ollama embed.
- **Reflex drafting correctness**: `bash -n`/`py_compile` gate at approval (broken scripts are refused instead of burning runs), `set -euo pipefail` mandated (silent mid-script failures recorded false 'ok' runs and corrupted the reuse metric), params schema inferred from the LLM draft (agents see real arguments in the MCP tool), and related mistakes injected into the draft prompt as preflight guards. Reflex output now clips head+tail — failures live at the END of logs and head-truncation discarded exactly that signal.

### Fixed

- **Migration output corrupted the MCP JSON-RPC stream**: `database.py`/`migrations.py` printed progress to stdout, which the MCP server uses for framing — the first tool call after a schema upgrade broke the session. Routed to logging.
- **Dedup fingerprints diverged between CLI and MCP** (MCP omitted `prevention` for mistakes): shared canonical content builders in `memory_ops`.
- `git rev-parse` was forked on every search for project affinity — memoized per path.
- `urllib.request` import deferred (~30ms off every non-embedding CLI command).

### Added

- **Reflex run history (schema v15)** — every execution recorded in `reflex_runs` (status, duration); `engram efficiency` reports measured success rates, not just streaks. Reflex timeout raised to 300s for real workflows (test suites, builds).
- **`ENGRAM_EMBED_MAX_CHARS`** — optional per-document embedding length cap; embedding time scales ~linearly with input length, so this is the honest bulk-ingest speed lever. Measured on Apple Silicon: embeddinggemma is 5x *slower* than nomic-embed-text via Ollama despite fewer params (noted in the model table) — benchmark before switching models.
- **Action Ladder** — the framework surface for token efficiency + action correctness (ADR 0006). `engram route` / MCP `memory_route` answers "cheapest correct way to do this task" in one budgeted call: an approved reflex to invoke, prior art to follow, or reason-then-capture; known mistakes surface as pitfall warnings on every rung. Reflexes auto-demote after 2 consecutive failures (approval revoked, failure captured as a mistake — schema v14 adds `fail_streak`); skills used 5+ times surface as promotion candidates in `engram health`; `engram efficiency` reports measured ladder stats with conservative token floors only.
- **Reflexes (experimental)** — proven skills can be promoted to executable, human-approved scripts that agents invoke as MCP tools (`reflex_<name>`) instead of re-reasoning through the workflow text each call (~50 tokens vs thousands, deterministic). Lifecycle: `engram promote <skill_id>` drafts a script (LLM-assisted or template), a human reviews and runs `engram reflex approve <id>` (approval pins the script hash — later edits un-approve it), and approved reflexes appear in `tools/list` across every MCP client. Params are passed as `PARAM_<KEY>` env vars, never interpolated into the script; unapproved or tampered scripts refuse to run. Schema v13 adds the `reflexes` table.
- `engram bootstrap --omit-project-integration` and sentinel file `.omit-agent-integration` (project root) to skip Cursor rules + Antigravity `instructions.md` while still initializing the database and MCP when applicable.
- README guidance on explicitly asking for retrieval (Agent Integration).
- Hybrid search merges semantic vs lexical rankings with reciprocal rank fusion (RRF); FTS query tokenization aligns with BM25/ranking tokenizer; tests in `tests/test_rrf.py`.
- In-process LRU cache for query embeddings (`src/embeddings.py`, 256 entries) — the Ollama HTTP round-trip dominated search latency (~85% in profiling); repeated queries in a long-lived MCP session now skip it. `clear_embedding_cache()` resets it.
- Schema parity regression test (`tests/test_migrations.py::test_fresh_schema_matches_migrated_schema`) — fails if `SCHEMA_SQL` and the migration chain diverge.

- **Pluggable embedding backends** — `ENGRAM_EMBED_URL` now selects an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/embeddings` endpoint (with `ENGRAM_EMBED_API_KEY`); unset keeps local Ollama; `disabled` turns embeddings off cleanly (short-circuits before any HTTP).
- **Flexible embedding dimensions** — `engram migrate-embeddings --target-model <model>` probes the model's real output dimension and rebuilds `vec_memory` at the new width when it differs (vectors are regenerated from FTS content). Write paths validate against the live `schema_meta.vec_dimension` instead of a hardcoded 768.
- **`src/config.py`** — every environment variable Engram reads, documented and resolved in one module.
- **MCP elicitation (spec 2025-06-18+)** — destructive tools (`memory_gc` non-dry-run, `memory_sleep`) ask the user for confirmation via `elicitation/create` when the client advertises the capability; clients without it keep the previous behavior.
- **Tokens-per-query in benchmarks** — `longmemeval_bench` and `engram_retrieval_bench` report `context_tokens` per query and `avg_context_tokens` in the aggregate (the 2026 memory-benchmark comparison axis alongside accuracy).
- **Claude Code skill** — `engram claude-skill` installs `claude-skills/engram-memory/SKILL.md` into `~/.claude/skills/` so Claude Code searches memory before non-trivial tasks and captures lessons afterward.
- **`engram install`** — one-shot setup: detects Cursor / Claude Code / Antigravity on the machine and wires all global integrations (Cursor MCP config, Claude skill, `~/.gemini/AGENTS.md` snippet); `--all` forces every integration.
- **`engram import-claude-memories`** — imports Claude Code's file-based memories (`~/.claude/**/memory/*.md`) into Engram, idempotent by content hash, so native Claude memories become searchable across every tool.
- **Capture→reuse metric** — `engram health` (and the MCP health tool) now report what share of memories captured 30+ days ago were ever used again, per type and overall, with a recommendation when reuse is low. This is the capture-quality signal.
- **Real LongMemEval retrieval eval** — `longmemeval_bench.py --oracle-file longmemeval_oracle.json` ingests all haystack sessions into one corpus (~950 sessions) and grades session-level Recall@k/MRR against `answer_session_ids`, per question type, with tokens-per-query. First full run (2026-07-06): session-level R@5 0.538 / MRR 0.442 over 940 sessions, 218 ms and 374 tokens per query, fully local; results and caveats published in `benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md`.
- **Leaner MCP search injection** — `memory_search` default limit 10→5 with rank-aware snippets (500 chars for the top hit, 150 below): ~34% fewer context tokens per search on a real corpus (845→560) while the top hit carries 3× more detail; `estimate_context_tokens` in benchmarks now mirrors this injected format instead of raw row sizes.
- Connection reuse on the search hot path — one connection per search (was 8), plus a `connection_scope` helper for multi-step operations.
- sqlite-vec pinned to >=0.1.9 (proper DELETE/space reclamation in vec0 tables).
- **Batched + deferred embeddings** — `embed_batch` (one HTTP round-trip per 16 docs with per-item fallback), `ENGRAM_DEFER_EMBED=1` write-fast mode (FTS rows land instantly, vectors fill in via batched `engram reembed`), used by the LongMemEval ingest; corpus ingestion is now crash-resumable.
- **Explicit-date ranking boost** — queries mentioning a date ("in May 2023", "2024-03") boost items whose date matches by ISO prefix. A directional heuristic ("first"/"most recent") was benchmarked on LongMemEval and removed (no R@5 effect, slightly negative MRR) — see benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md.
- **Turn-window chunked ingestion** — `create_conversation_chunked` indexes overlapping turn-windows as sibling rows so buried single-sentence evidence gets its own vector; `--chunked` flag on the oracle benchmark. Benchmarked 2026-07-08: **regression** (aggregate R@5 0.540→0.500, preference 0.367→0.200) — windows crowd out the top-k without parent-level aggregation; stays opt-in and off by default, diagnosis in BENCHMARKS.md.
- **Reuse-aware capture** — `suggest_capture` consults per-type reuse rates (`get_reuse_rates`) and warns when a suggested type historically never gets retrieved again.

### Fixed

- **Embedding normalization (schema v12)** — Ollama's legacy `/api/embeddings` returns unnormalized vectors while the newer `/api/embed` returns unit vectors; mixing them under euclidean KNN silently partitioned the vector index (queries only matched same-endpoint documents). All vectors are now L2-normalized in code, and migration v12 rescales existing stored vectors in place — no re-embedding needed.
- Fresh databases were missing schema v11 objects (`memory_facts` table, `superseded_by` columns, `codebase_knowledge.file_mtime`) because they were added only in migrations, never in the baseline `SCHEMA_SQL`. `memory_invalidate` with a reason crashed on new installs.
- `engram suggest-consolidate` and `run_sleep` crashed (or reported `clusters_found == 2` on an empty database) — both treated the `(clusters, skip_reason)` tuple from `find_consolidation_candidates` as the cluster list.
- Flaky search performance test: the 500ms budget included a live Ollama embedding call (800ms+ on a cold model load); the query embedding is now stubbed so the test measures the SQL/ranking path it was written to guard.
- `engram doctor --repair` built the orphaned-tags DELETE by string interpolation; now parameterized.
- Silent `except: pass` handlers in `temporal.py`, `maintenance.py`, and `database.py` now log (one of them had already hidden the fresh-install schema bug).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- Unified `memory_add` MCP tool — consolidates `memory_add_mistake`, `memory_add_pattern`, and `memory_add_skill` into a single dispatching tool with explicit `type` field
- `memory_suggest_capture` MCP tool — heuristic-driven auto-drafting of memory entries from task description and outcome; no LLM required
- `engram browse` CLI command — interactive curses-based TUI for browsing and searching memory entries without leaving the terminal
- `engram suggest-capture` CLI command — surface capture suggestions directly from the CLI
- Modular CLI architecture: `src/cli/` package with 7 focused command modules (`memory`, `codebase`, `sync`, `bootstrap`, `maintenance`, `session`, `tools`)
- `src/capture.py` — standalone heuristic capture engine with domain inference, signal detection, and structured draft generation
- `src/browse.py` — curses TUI browser with search, type-filter, and detail view
- Three-mode Cursor rule system: **LIGHT** (default, one search at session start), **FULL** (auto-escalates on complexity signals), **COMMITTEE** (explicit opt-in only via `@engram committee`)
- `SearchResults` list subclass in `src/search.py` to safely carry a `semantic_status` attribute on search result lists
- `phases` and `phase_requirements` columns added to the `workflows` table (schema + migration v8)
- Comprehensive test suite: `tests/test_capture.py` (23 tests), `tests/test_cli_commands.py` (12 tests), `tests/test_workflow.py` (16 tests)
- **Retrieval benchmark hardening (v1.1.0):** `benchmarks/grading.py` with id-based ground truth (`expected_type` + `expected_item_id`) and title fallback; `benchmarks/test_queries.json` aligned to the seed; optional `--failure-detail` and `failed_query_ids` + `top_hits_detail` in JSON on `engram_retrieval_bench.py`
- `evals/` — optional labeled real-DB evaluation (`evals/README.md`, `real_queries.json.example`); not run in CI by default
- `benchmarks/inject_noise.py` — reproducible distractor stress test; interpretation notes in `benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md`

### Fixed
- MCP schema mismatch: `memory_add_skill` tool definition used `trigger_desc` instead of `trigger` — corrected to match the handler
- `advance_phase` bug: phase advancement previously ignored custom workflows stored in the `workflows` table; now correctly loads phases and role requirements via `_load_workflow_phases`
- `init_session_state` read-before-commit bug: calling `get_session_state` inside the same write transaction made the inserted row invisible; moved the read to after the write connection commits
- `SearchResults` attribute error: `search()` tried to set `.semantic_status` on a plain `list`, causing `AttributeError` when semantic search was skipped — fixed with `SearchResults(list)` subclass
- N+1 query in `get_project_affinities`: replaced per-result queries with a single batched `WHERE (item_type, item_id, project_id) IN (VALUES ...)` query
- Wrong GitHub URL in the bootstrap command
- MCP codebase tools (`memory_index_file`, `memory_query_codebase`, `memory_get_stale_files`) no longer spawn subprocess calls — reimplemented with direct Python database calls

### Changed
- CLI entry point updated from `src.cli_legacy` to `src.cli:main` (the new modular package)
- Adaptive Cursor rule simplified from 122 lines to ~50 lines with clearer mode definitions
- Committee workflow is now strictly opt-in: removed automatic escalation triggers; only activates on explicit `@engram committee` / `use committee` / `committee workflow` phrases
- `cli.py` renamed to `cli_legacy.py` (deprecated, kept for reference only during transition)
